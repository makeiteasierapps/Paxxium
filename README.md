# <span style="color:#FF69B4">Paxxium</span>
### Intro
I started building Paxxium during the backend course of my coding bootcamp right during the time ChatGPT was becoming popular. As soon as I realized there was an API I started building. I didn't know React and had very little experience building out a server with Python and Flask but decided what better way to learn. With that being said, this was a school project, it does work but the code could be crap, I don't know I am still learning.
