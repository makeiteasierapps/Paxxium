Client Framework:
    - React
    - Java Script
    - MUI 5

Rules:
- Use MUI 5 components for styling
    - Use Styled Components when it makes sense
        - Use the shouldForwardProp prop to forward props to the component

State Management:
    - Context API
    - I feed custom hooks into my Context Providers and consume them through useContext.
